## Overview

[Relational Rails](https://github.com/ElliotOlbright/Relational_Rails) is a week long paired project during Mod 2 of 4 for Turing School's Back-End Engineering program.

The goal was to create a functioning Rails Application that can take users through a website and give them the ability to operate CRUD commands - Create, Read, Update and Destroy data while being able to veiw the changes on the website(Rails Application)
